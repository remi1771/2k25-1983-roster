Changelog V4: 
o	-Updated John Duren’s appearance and removed WIP status
o	-Removed Free Agents Duplicates
o	-Updates to Charles Jones
-	Official Cyberface + Body
-	Updates official stats to accurately reflect his ’83 season. His 2kMT card is from when he played in WSB (from 27 to 35 years old (he was 25 on ’83)). 
•	Because his official max Potential is 80 and his card is 72, I assume the card is not of his best season (Neither ’90(Second best FG%). ’91 (Best FG%))
•	The shirt he’s wearing on the image (Mainly red shirt, non-italicized number)  started being used in the ’90 season, and because he played the ’94 season in DET, I’m assuming the card is for his ’93 season.
•	When checking Per 36 minutes, some trends are clearer, the younger he is the higher his Field Goals. I’ll compare it (’93) to his ’86 (played similar amounts of minutes) season and adjust from there.
